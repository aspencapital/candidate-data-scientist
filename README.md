# candidate-data-scientist

Dear Data-scientist: 
First, thank you for your time to work through the case study for Aspen Capital. 
To get a better understanding of how you think, analyze, design and implement a solution to a problem, we have created a case study for you to complete over the next 72 hours.
The case study: A company wants to build a go-to-hub board-games recommendation product for its customers. You are the subject matter expert who works in close collaboration with business Stakeholders to answer this question: What are the 3 games we should recommend to each customer? 
We realize that to develop a *complete* solution here would take longer than you probably have to work on this. We are mostly interested in going through your thought process and seeing how you would approach it rather than getting a finalized polished product, so we expect you to not spend more than ~6 hours working on it. Feel free to expand on how you would approach future work on this project given the time. 

The Data set: 
● boardgames.csv are boardgame specific features 
● boardgame-frequent-users.csv are the ratings each user gave to each game 

Your goal is to: 
1. Predict the top 3 games to recommend to each user. 
a. Please explain your methodology and take us through the decisions you made
b. Describe how you tested the results of the model and what metrics are important to monitor

Deliverables: 
● One pdf document that includes code and any presentation slides 
● Presentation to the team on the scheduled Interview day 

Notes and instructions: 
● Please take the time to familiarize yourself with the data and concepts prior to starting the project and feel free to ask questions if there’s anything you don’t understand
● Please document any assumptions you make (for anything that is unclear)
● The timeline for turning it around is 72 hours from the time of delivery
● Please save and attach your project in its entirety in one pdf document, including code that you provide and any slides

We ask that you present your findings to the team on the scheduled day of your interview.
